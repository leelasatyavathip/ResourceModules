# Common Azure Resource Modules Library

The objective of this repository is to provide a template library that can accelerate deployments in Infrastructure as Code scenarios, such as Azure landing zones, landing zone accelerators and aspiring landing zone accelerators (workloads/applications/multi-module solutions) or individual service deployments.

This wiki describes the content of this repository, its modules, pipelines, and possible options on how to use them and how to contribute to this project.

If you're unfamiliar with Infrastructure as Code or wonder how you can use the content of this repository in your deployments, check out [The context](./The%20context) section of this wiki.

# Scope

Following, you can find an abstract overview of everything in- and out-of-scope of this repository.

## In Scope

- **Module library:** A collection of comprehensive, reusable, Bicep-based building blocks to deploy Azure resources, that can be combined to create & orchestrate more complex, multi-module Azure solutions.
- **CI environment:** Pipelines to validate modules & publish the successfully validated ones to a target location, using semantic versioning. Available with both GitHub Workflows and Azure DevOps pipelines.
- **Documentation:** Including design principles and usage of [The library](./The%20library) and [The CI environment](./The%20CI%20environment) as well as step-by-step guidelines on how to start leveraging them - see in the [Getting started](./Getting%20started) section.

## Out of Scope

- **Orchestration:** Orchestrated, multi-module solutions such as workloads or applications intended for production environments.
- **Real-time Updates:** Modules are updated on a best effort basis by a group of committed contributors.
- **Languages:** Other domain-specific languages (DSL), like _Terraform_.
